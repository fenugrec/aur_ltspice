# it's a mess. Helpfiles are lowercase .htm and .html, but the internal, relative links have mixed-case names. Thanks Microsoft and Analog.

#This will break if the structure of the helpfiles changes, because parsing html with regex is Evil

# Assumes :
# - links to .css and images don't need to be changed
# - all .htm(l) filenames are lowercase (if not, there is a script in the git log...)

#one exception -
mv LTspiceR.htm ltspicer.htm
